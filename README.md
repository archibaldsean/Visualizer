# Data Structures and Algorithms Visualizer

A web-based application for visualizing various data structures and algorithms in real-time. This project includes interactive visualizations for sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort) and graph traversal algorithms (Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search). It was built using React with TypeScript and modern CSS layouts (Flexbox and CSS Grid).

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Step-by-step animations for each algorithm.
- **Multiple Display Modes**:
  - Sorting visualizations with bars and array boxes.
  - Graph algorithms displayed as binary trees or node-based graphs.
- **Modular Code**: Algorithms are implemented using generator functions to yield intermediate states, making it easy to extend.

## Technologies Used

- **React** with **TypeScript**
- **CSS** (Flexbox & CSS Grid)
- JavaScript Generators for step-by-step animations
